                <p class='font-light text-xl'>
                    Atrioc hoards his knowledge (much like his coffee) from chat.
                    Despite no fault of chat's own, when innocently asked "any book
                    recommendations?" in attempt to learn from his ways, chat is
                    berated. Well no more, chat should not have knowledge gatekept and
                    this site shall unleash that access.

                    How Book Club Works
                </h1>
                <p class='font-light text-xl'>
                    When Dr. Carbonation mentions a book that he is reading, anyone
                    can come and submit that book and a clip from stream of Glizzy
                    Fingers talking about it to be kept in the records. Additionally,
                    any books that chat would like to share can be submitted for the
                    record. Once submitted, books are added to an approval queue
                    before being added to the recommendations page where they are
                    dividied by Atrioc & chat recommendations and shared with the
                    community.
