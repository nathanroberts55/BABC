                <p class="lead">Atrioc hoards his knowledge (much like his coffee)
                    from chat. Despite no fault of chat's own, when innocently asked "any book recommendations?" in
                    attempt to learn from his ways, chat is
                    berated. Well no more, chat should not have knowledge gatekept and this site shall unleash that
                    acess.</p>

                <p class="lead">When Dr. Carbonation mentions a book that he is reading, anyone can come and submit that
                    book and a clip from steam of Glizzy Fingers talking about it to be kept in the records.
                    Additionally, any books that chat would like to share can be submitted for the record.
                    Once submitted, books are added to an approval queue before being added to the recommendations page
                    where they are dividied by Atrioc & chat recommendations and shared with the community.</p>
